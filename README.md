# RemoteLogger

## Work in progress
I probably butchered ExpressJS and Kotlin Coroutines here, but it works :)

Library that allows to send Logcat logs via websocket to server hosted on developer machine - useful when app has to be in release mode without developer options turned on (real live case...)
